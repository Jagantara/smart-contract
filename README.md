# Jagantara üõ°Ô∏è

Jagantara is a decentralized insurance platform that gives people a fair and transparent way to protect themselves from unexpected losses. Instead of relying on a traditional insurance company, users pay a regular premium directly into a smart contract. When something happens and a user needs to make a claim, the community of token holders‚Äîthrough a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) reviews and votes on whether the claim should be approved.

Jagantara doesn't just protect claimants; it also rewards users who help secure the system. Anyone can stake stablecoins like USDC in the protocol to support its financial health. In return, they receive a token called JagaToken, which gives them the right to vote on claims and earn a share of the protocol's revenue. This creates a balanced ecosystem where claimants, voters, and stakers all play important roles. The system is governed entirely by code, with no centralized authority, making it transparent, secure, and community-driven from end to end.

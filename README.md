# Jagantara üõ°Ô∏è

Jagantara is a decentralized insurance platform that gives people a fair and transparent way to protect themselves from unexpected losses. Instead of relying on a traditional insurance company, users pay a regular premium directly into a smart contract. When something happens and a user needs to make a claim, the community of token holders‚Äîthrough a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) reviews and votes on whether the claim should be approved.

Jagantara doesn't just protect claimants; it also rewards users who help secure the system. Anyone can stake stablecoins like USDC in the protocol to support its financial health. In return, they receive a token called JagaToken, which gives them the right to vote on claims and earn a share of the protocol's revenue. This creates a balanced ecosystem where claimants, voters, and stakers all play important roles. The system is governed entirely by code, with no centralized authority, making it transparent, secure, and community-driven from end to end.

- 25% ‚Üí ClaimManager (Payout Vault)
- 30% ‚Üí JagaStake (Staking Rewards)
- 20% ‚Üí Owner
- 25% ‚Üí MorphoReinvest (Reinvestment)

## Claiming Flow

1. User submits a claim via DAOGovernance.
2. Claim is voted on by users holding JagaToken.
3. If yes vote reached 66% after minimum of 5 days it produces approve response for the proposal.
4. If yes vote hasn't reached 66% after maximum of 7 days it produces reject response for the proposal.
5. If approved, user calls ClaimManager.claimPayout(claimId) to receive funds. Otherwise if rejected.

## Staking Flow

1. Stake USDC via JagaStake to receive JagaToken.
2. JagaToken grants DAO voting rights.
3. Rewards are distributed per 30 days.
4. Rewards come from 30% of protocol revenue (notifyRewardAmount).
